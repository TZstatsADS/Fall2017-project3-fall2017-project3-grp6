# Project: Dogs, Fried Chicken or Blueberry Muffins? 

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions and code. You might want to look at the working directories because they are finished by different group members. However Sijian tries to make them organized. Just in case, if you have any questions pleasse contact sx2195@columbia.edu.

If you want to run lbpfeature_extraction.m, setting the working directory instruction in the comments.
For write_img_names.py and all R files the working directory should be fine.
